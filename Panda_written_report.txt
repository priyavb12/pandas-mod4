Summarizes the analysis: 

1.Read the data using pd.read_csv

2.The file is completely checked to understand the structure using df.head()

3.Calculations made like average, percentage, passing rate, overall performance.

4.df.groupby() for particular student or school to find specific column, to group data and calculate

5.Comparison of school performance. Identifying top school.

6.pd.cut used to slice the values. 

7.Data cleaning is done using .sort_values to find overall passing.

8.Analyze how school size and type (charter vs. district) affect academic performance.



Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:

1. By analyzing the different scores such as math, reading, passing rates between different schools , best      performances of each school can be identified.

2. This helps in improvising the school performance wherever needed.

3. sometimes school type and size also affects the school performance.

   So this analysis helps in understanding the relationship between performance and school size and type.
